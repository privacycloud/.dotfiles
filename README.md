# .dotfiles

This is my personal setup for macOS. It is quite opinionated, so I would not expect it to perfectly fit into your own workflow.

Please, feel free to download this code and customize whatever you need to make it work :)

## Usage

Use `make` to run some predefined tasks:

* `make all` installs my whole tooling suite as well as my own dotfiles
* `make tools` installs only the tooling suite (by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh))
* `make dotfiles` installs only the dotfiles (by using symlinks)
