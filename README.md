# .dotfiles

This is my personal setup for macOS. It is quite opinionated, so I would not expect it to perfectly fit into your own workflow.

Please, feel free to download this code and customize whatever you need to make it work for you :relaxed:

## Usage

Use `make` to run some predefined tasks:

* `make all` installs the whole tooling suite as well as the dotfiles
* `make tools` installs only the tooling suite ([brew](https://brew.sh), [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell))
* `make dotfiles` installs only the dotfiles (by using symlinks)
