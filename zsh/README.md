# ZSH

Set of files for **ZSH**. They require the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework for working successfully.

Some additional plug-ins which *should* be installed:

* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

## Themes

The `prose` theme is forked from [My Extravagant Zsh Prompt](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/) by Steve Losh. It requires the
[hg-prompt](http://sjl.bitbucket.org/hg-prompt/) extension for showing the Mercurial's prompt.
